Ask the user what colors they would like to add
Create a NEW Set with colors the user adds
Then utilize the `union` Set method to combine sets
display the new Set

"""
Write a Tuple that contains strings that represent coins
There will be three types of coins: "gold", "silver", and "copper"
For example: ("gold", "silver", "copper", "gold")
Note that there are duplicates (imagine coins in a purse)
Next, write a function that displays all coins using a WHILE loop

Take the Tuple from Problem 4 and add a new coin to it
Then, display all of the coins in the Tuple after adding the coin
